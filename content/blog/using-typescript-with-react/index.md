I started using React with JS for a couple years before I made a decicision to try out Typescript. There was no particular reason why I did it, I simply thought it would just be another tool to learn. The initial adaptation took a bit work, but the overall experience has been nothing short of great.

In this blog, I will try to summarize a few key differences between developing in Typescript vs Javascript.

## 1. Types

I do not have any experience using staticly typed langauage. I was not really sure of the benefits either, but after a few weeks of using it, it was surely mind blowing. I am sure we have all done this in Javascript. Write a few lines of code, run it in browser, hold our breath, and check the console if it screams at us. Typescript does not solve that problem entirely, but it covers 80%-90% of the case. It catches most of the error during development in vsCode.

## 2. Build

I moved `App.js` file to a different folder, it seems like that is not allowed. It needs to be `export default` and it has to be located in root folder.

## 3. Debugger

How do you use debugger is not very intuative.

## 4. Debugger 2.0

How to open network tab

## 5. Absolute path

Add a package json with name

## 6. No need for route guard

## 7. localhost will not work if you are using real device
